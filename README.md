# Best-Recipes
A collection of my favorite and tested recipes. I have a bad habit of either printing off the recipe and 
using it once, then it ends up in my huge stack of all the other recipes I have printed; or losing the 
website I used previously to make the dish and it ends up turning out not how I wanted it to. My husband 
suggested a recipe book at first and I just had the idea to make it a digital one instead to hopefully 
showcase some of my computer science skills as I am graduating with a bachelor's in soon.
