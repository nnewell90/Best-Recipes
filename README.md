# Best-Recipes
This is a work in progress!

This repository contains a curated collection of my favorite tried and tested recipes. I often
found myself printing recipes only to lose them in a stack of papers or forgetting the website
where I found a particular dish, leading to diappointing outcomes. To address this, my husband
suggested a traditional recipe book, but I decided to create a digital one instead. Not only
does this help me organize my recipes better, but it also serves as a showcase of my computer
science skills as I approach graduation with a bachelor's degree in the field.
